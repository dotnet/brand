# .NET Brand Guidelines

The purpose of these guidelines is to provide a framework for communicating with the .NET developer community and establishing a consistent brand identity. This repo serves as a guide and reference to designers, writers, and developers to create consistent, on-brand content for .NET. 

Read the [.NET Brand Guidelines](dotnet-styleGuide-2024.pdf).

## Logo

The .NET logo is one of the most simple and direct visual representations of the .NET brand. The .NET logo purple color is #512bd4. Please read the brand guidelines for proper uses of the logo. 

See the [logo](/logo) folder.

## Illustrations
These illustrations are more than sketches, they’re stories full of character, delightful surprises—and layers of meaning, many containing the [dotnet-bot](https://github.com/dotnet-bot). The dotnet-bot represents the community that comes with the .NET brand and platform. Dotnet-bot also helps with checking pull-requests on .NET repos. Please read the brand guidelines for proper uses. 

See the [dotnet-bot-illustrations](/dotnet-bot-illustrations) folder.

## Presentation Template
You can use the presentation template as a starting point for your presentations to the .NET developer community. It contains type, theme colors, and illustrations that follow the brand guidelines. 

See the [presentation-template](/presentation-template) folder.

## Type

The Open Sans typeface helps express the humanity in our voice and personality across all our communications. Open Sans is an open source typeface designed by Steve Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp.

You can download it from Google Fonts: [fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)
